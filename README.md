# TIC-TAC-TOE

This particular game of tic-tac-toe is played entirely in the terminal. There is a basic interface that displays the board in between turns. Each player's score is tracked in between matches.

Among the necessary skills required to complete this project, I learned about:
* **Frozen string literals** and how it would affect modifying strings
* Adding comments to describe a module or class
* Using **hashes** to store information
* Using a **module** to group related methods together
* Using a **class** from which to create methods and objects from
* **Instantiating** a new object from a class
* Using **instance variables** to track the state of each instance
* Using **setter and getter methods** when working with instance variables
* Creating **predicate methods** instead of resorting to repeated `if..else` statements
* **Looping through nested arrays** (to check if a user has won in this case)
* Using a **linter** to help improve code legibility

Although I began to think about object-oriented design, there is room for improvement.
